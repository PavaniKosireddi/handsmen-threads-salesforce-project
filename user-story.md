# 📘 User Story & Project Overview

## 🧑‍💼 User Story

As a Business Manager at HandsMen Threads,  
I want to track customer interactions, purchases, and loyalty status in one place,  
So that I can offer personalized services and improve business decision-making.

As a Warehouse Team Member,  
I want to receive stock alerts when inventory is low,  
So that I can restock items on time and avoid customer delays.

As a Developer/Admin,  
I want to automate tasks such as email notifications, loyalty tier updates, and bulk order processing,  
So that manual work is reduced, and the system runs efficiently.
