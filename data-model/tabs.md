# 🗂️ Custom Tabs – HandsMen Threads

To ensure easy access and navigation for end users, custom tabs were created for each of the following custom objects:

- HandsMen Customer  
- HandsMen Product  
- HandsMen Order  
- Inventory  
- Marketing Campaign

These tabs allow users to view, create, and manage records directly from the navigation menu in the Lightning App.
